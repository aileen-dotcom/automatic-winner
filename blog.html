      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Aileen! I'm a detail-oriented and tech-savvy professional with a diverse background spanning data administration, healthcare, education, and financial services. I bring experience in HRIS systems, data accuracy, and empathetic communication across culturally diverse environments.</p>
      
      <p>My journey has taken me from managing international conferences and advisory at University to supporting healthcare teams during challenging times, earning recognition including the COVID-19 Response Recognition Award. With qualifications ranging from a Masters degree to certifications in Microsoft Excel, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and Machine Learning, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not diving into data or coding in GitHub, you'll find me staying active through <strong>swimming</strong>, <strong>volleyball</strong>, and <strong>dancing</strong>. I love expressing my creative side through <strong>sketching</strong>, <strong>calligraphy</strong>, <strong>accordion</strong>, and <strong>photography</strong>. I actively <strong>volunteer</strong> in the local communities, believing that giving back strengthens us all.</p>
      
      <p>This blog captures my ongoing job search journey, professional insights, and the lessons I'm learning along the way. Let's connect and grow together in this ever-evolving tech landscape!</p>
